You Have My Back

Names were changed to protect the innocent

While Texas technically lies in the United States, rest assured that Texans are different than other States, or any other part of the world. Up until a few years ago, Texas was the largest state, and its proud inhabitants do not hesitate to point out how large their state is. And remind people that everything is bigger in Texas.
One reason Texans are a tough breed is the torrid weather of bitterly cold winters followed by scorching summers reaching over 100 degrees for months on end. Texans outlasted four different flags before becoming their own country and eventually joined the United States. I grew up in Dallas, where gun ownership and knowing how to use pistols, rifles, and shotguns for hunting and self-protection were a standard part of the culture. A rifle hanging in the back window of a pickup truck was a coming of age symbol, with most people keeping weapons in their homes. Criminals knew it, and crime was low. When we were mad at each other, we used our fists to straighten things out. Then we’d shake hands and drink a beer together. We never thought about drawing weapons for the sake of fighting.
This is a story about guns and police that, in today’s world, is hard to believe. But it happened as written.

***

Seventy-year-old Nancy Waters lived alone in San Antonio when it was experiencing a rash of robberies. A recently installed burglar alarm in her house provided peace of mind, but her 28-gauge shotgun still stayed under the bed. One night at 3:30 a.m., Nancy jolted wide-awake when her burglar alarm screeched. The house was dark. The alarm was deafening, causing her to breathe hard. In a fog, she grabbed her loaded shotgun and turned off the alarm. She turned on a bedroom light and called the police. She was relieved when they answered right away.
“911. May I help you?”
“My alarm went off. I think someone’s in my house.”
“Are you hurt?”
“No.”
“Please take a deep breath and calm yourself. Where are you?”
“In my bedroom. With a gun.”
“Good. Just stay there. An officer will arrive shortly.”
“Hurry up.”
Nancy turned off the bedroom light and waited with her shotgun loaded and safety off. The silence after the alarm was deafening. Wind scratched a tree limb across her roof. Dogs barked outside. What was taking them so long?
Fifteen minutes later, a police car pulled into her driveway. An officer walked to the front door with his pistol drawn. He knocked. Nancy crept down the hallway, staring at every shadow. Was anyone else in the house? She reached her front door and turned on the outside light. She opened the door and pointed her shotgun outside. A policeman stood there, not moving.
“Thank God you’re here.”
“Mrs. Waters?” he asked.
“Yes.”
“Would you please lower your weapon?”
“Oh, yes.” She lowered the barrel, but her hands shook as she kept a firm grip on the stock.
“I’m Officer Hernandez. May I come in?”
“Yes, yes.”
She unlocked the screen and turned on the inside lights. The officer stepped in with his pistol pointed up.
“Is your shotgun loaded?”
"Well, of course. It wouldn't do me any good if it weren't."
“Do you live alone?”
“Yes, just me.”
“Tell me what happened.”
“I was sleeping, and the alarm went off. We've had break-ins around the neighborhood. I’m so glad I bought an alarm system.”
“Have you had false alarms with your new system?”
“No. This is the first time it’s gone off.”
“Did you hear anything else?”
“No.”
“Where is your room?”
She pointed to the right hall.
“What’s in the left hall?”
“More bedrooms.”
“I have to check them out.”
He aimed his pistol down the hall and said, “Take that shotgun and walk behind me to cover my back. Point it to our rear.”
“You want me to come with you?” she asked with disbelief.
“Yes. That's the safest place for you to be in case there's trouble, and I won't accidentally shoot you. Can you do that?"
She took a deep breath and nodded.
He slowly walked down the hall with Nancy behind him. Her heart pounded as she walked sideways, pointing her shotgun to their rear. Floorboards creaked as they stepped on them. Trees whispered in the wind outside.
Officer Hernandez snuck his hand around the corner to turn on lights in the first bedroom and jerked back. He looked again, pistol at full extension.
“A window’s broken,” he said. “Let me clear the room.”
Officer Hernandez checked the bathroom, closets, and under the beds while Nancy stood guard in the hallway. Her trembling hands pointed the shotgun toward the last bedroom. She couldn’t believe this was happening.
“This room is clear,” he said. “Do you see anything missing?”
"No. There's nothing in here worth stealing."
“How many bedrooms do you have?”
“Three.”
“Let’s go to the next one.”
He turned on lights in another bedroom and cleared it.
“Now the rest of the house. He still might be here.”
When they carefully entered the living room, Nancy pointed to another broken window. He nodded. With the officer leading and Nancy covering his back, they carefully searched the rest of the house.
“There’s no one here,” he said. “You can put your weapon down.”
She placed her shotgun in a corner and collapsed into a chair. Nancy closed her eyes and panted hard. What a terrible night.
“Are you okay?” Officer Hernandez asked.
“Yes.
“It looks like a burglar broke into the first bedroom where glass is on the floor. Your alarm scared him before he stole anything. In a panic, he ran through the dark and broke out the other window where shattered glass is outside.
“I’m so glad you showed up. Sitting in the dark waiting for you was terrible. If somebody had entered, I would have shot him.”
“I have no doubt you would.”
Nancy waited thirty minutes for the officer to write up his report and leave. She kept her lights on and stayed awake, holding onto the shotgun until sunrise. The burglar might come back through the broken windows, but she was ready. This was her house, and no one was going to scare her out of it.

Like I said, life is different, and people are tough in Texas, where little old ladies watch a policemen’s back.</p>

<h2 style="color:purple; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Fiasco at Frank’s</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">	
As I was wrapping up practice for our youth basketball team I spotted another parent/coach from across the gymnasium. I was trying to coax his youngest son into playing basketball for my team the following season so I made my way over to him. The kid was a talented baseball and football player so I felt I could teach him the game and he would be a great addition to our team. He was considering it and I knew if I got dad on board he’d agree. I figured I’d make some small talk and ease into it before I gave him my pitch.

“Hey TJ, what’s going on man?”
“Hey Cam, I’m here to pick up Jared.”

We shook hands then looked out on the court at his eldest son enjoying practice in his first ever season of basketball.

“Looks like Jared is having fun out there.”
“Yeah, he don’t know quite what he’s doing yet but he’s having fun.”
“That’s where it starts at. Just like baseball, once you get them to love the game everything else just falls in place. Speaking of which, you know I’ve been talking to Jackson. I’m putting together a team for the winter and I would like for him to be on…”

I stopped in mid sentence after seeing the huge bandage on his forearm.

“Man TJ what happened to you? You been hanging out at Franks?”

I was just making an innocent joke about an incident I heard about from some of the parents of my young players. One of our local watering holes was the site of several stabbings a few nights before. No one was seriously injured but it was not a good look for the biker/sports bar.

“Well, I wasn’t hanging there but I got stabbed.”

I was shocked.

“What? You were one of the stabbing victims?! Hey I was just kidding man. Are you alright?”

He touched his bandage and looked down.

“Yeah, I’m fine. Luckily they didn’t cut any tendons or ligaments.”

He looked a little shook. I caught his eye and asked him again.

“Are you sure you’re alright?”

Slowly he answered me, still gently rubbing his wound.

“Yeah, I’m gonna be fine but I still feel a little anxious around crowds. I feel like I have to look out for people because you don’t know who’s got what and what they might do.”

TJ went on to explain to me the night’s events and how he became a part of this ugly situation. He was home when he received a call from his girlfriend and a group of his other friends. They were at Frank’s having too good of a time and needed a designated driver. He retrieved his intoxicated friends and as they made their way to his vehicle he could see a commotion brewing in the parking lot. TJ thought he saw someone from their party in danger and he went back to see if he was safe. Out of nowhere came the cold steel of the blade slicing into his flesh. He was treated and released but the memory of what happened still weighed on him heavily.

I asked him what caused all of this and he gave me a brief summary of what he knew of the event. I thought to myself how tragic it was that this man was assaulted with a weapon and he wasn’t exactly sure why or by whom. I needed to know more about what happened and who these people were that committed this horrible act. After reading the report of a young man punching his girlfriend and them both pulling knives on anyone who attempted to intervene, I drew my own mental picture of the people they might be and what brought them to this place in their lives.

Cam’s Fictional Account:

“Hurry up bitch. You spend all of your damn time in the mirror. Who you tryin’ ta look good for? We’re just goin’ out for some damn beers. Hurry the hell up before I drag your ass out of there!”

Tammy kept teasin’ her hair not saying a word. Her friend Samantha inquired about her demeanor.

“You don’t ever get tired of him talkin’ to you like that?”

Tammy waved her hand in the air.

“I ain’t studying nothin’ he’s sayin’ in there.”
“But what if he smacks you again?”
“Well if he does, he does. Won’t be the first time and probably won’t be the last.”

Samantha said no more about it but a strange look came over her face as she realized that she needed to choose her friends more carefully. Norman cursed Tammy more but he didn’t escalated to striking her in front of her new friend. Eventually they pulled out of the trailer park and sped down the road.

Norman was in the mood to raise some hell! He hollered out the window and spun the wheels on his big truck every chance he got. He sped into the parking lot pass a row of motorcycles and double parked near the entrance. Norman jumped out and left the two women behind. As they entered they could see him already bellied up to the bar shooting a shot of whiskey with some of his buddies. Tammy and Samantha were left to order their own drinks. Tammy and Norman didn’t spend much time around each other that night but he did watch her like a hawk. She could feel his jealous eyes on her and it excited her.

Samantha found some girlfriends of hers while she was there and secured herself a ride home. She had enough of the Norm and Tammy show. While they were there, Norman would walk by occasionally, pull Tammy to him and whisper threats in her ear. Samantha said goodbye to her new former friend and made a false promise to get together with her soon. Tammy was getting a little tipsy and she was attracting attention from some of the fellas at the bar as she danced by herself to her favorite White snake Song. She twisted and wound up like a wrist watch in her short cut off jean shorts and cowgirl boots. The white bottoms of the pockets stuck out in the front and a little but cheek showed in the back. Her tiny tank top rode up a little showing off her belly ring.

Norman knew that she was acting that way to make him crazy; that’s what she always did. Tammy knew too and she liked it. Tammy was addicted to the chaos. She had no understanding of how to love without violence. Tammy had never been in a healthy relationship before. People who were supposed to love her had been beating on her since she was a little girl and she showed her love by fighting back. She fought back with her fists, feet, nails and especially her words. Tammy would say the most awful things to the ones she “loved”. She possessed a sharp tongue and she cut deep with her words. Things that hurt you the most flowed freely from her lips, but only if she loved you.

As it got closer to last call, Norman got more pissed off with Tammy. He called for his tab and then slammed the payment down on the bar. Norman rushed over to where Tammy was dancing and snatched her by the arm and dragged her to the door, cussin’ and fussin’. She returned his insults and then some, drawing more of his rage out. A few people followed them out, concerned about the girl’s safety. When Norman got her to the truck there was some yelling, pushing and shoving. Then Norman reached back with a closed fist and punched Tammy square in the face.

Women in the parking lot started screaming and more people poured out of the bar. As men approached Norman asking what was going on he pulled a knife on them. That angered some of the men so they closed in on him. Then Tammy pulled a blade of her own and started using it. Norman brandished his knife to keep people off of him; Tammy drew her knife so that she could cut as many people as possible. The fact that they were coming to her rescue didn’t even enter Tammy’s damaged mind. All she saw was, they were attacking her man and she wanted to hurt them. TJ walked into her blade as she slashed at the crowd.

The Ocoee Police arrived and quickly restored order. The four stabbing victims were transported to two different hospitals within minutes. After gathering statements from witnesses Norman Swartz was arrested and charged with domestic battery. Tammy Perkins was charged with Aggravated Battery with a deadly weapon. In her head she did it for love. Fortunately the scars she caused that day on peoples flesh and on Frank’s Place’s reputation would heal but it will take a lot more to remove the deep jagged scar from her heart and mind that caused her to live such a volatile and violent life.

<h2 style="color:pink; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Finally, The Secret Was Out!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
I never knew my grandfather on my mother’s side. He’d been long gone before I was even born. As far as I was concerned, it had always been my grandmother, my mother, her sister, my aunt, and their brother, Al, also known as Sonny.
The night the secret was revealed to me, was a Christmas Eve. My parents had invited a slew of our relatives to our house in Connecticut for the holiday. When the temperature that night dropped to two degrees below zero, the last car to arrive, my uncle Sonny’s car, froze up, effectively preventing everyone from leaving.
Because my grandmother, who lived in the Bronx, had come with my uncle, she decided to go to bed early, leaving the rest of us to continue sitting around the dining room table drinking coffee and eating Italian pastries. During our post dinner festivities, my uncle announced that recently he had been contacted by his half brother.
Half brother?
I didn’t know anything about a half brother! But that’s when I learned who my grandfather had been. Not only had he been a philanderer several times over, he also had been a criminal, which explained a lot.
When I was a kid, who sometimes got cowboy guns for Christmas, my grandmother often seemed not too pleased about the guns. I just thought she didn’t like guns—actually, she didn’t, but not for the reasons I thought. The main reason she didn’t like guns was because my grandfather, who had run with a couple of criminals, had participated in a robbery where someone had been shot to death. This was a number of years after my uncle Sonny had been born. Not only did my grandfather and his two companions go to prison, all three went to the electric chair!
Wow! Some revelation!
Luckily, by this time, I was in my thirties, so finding out about my grandfather was nowhere near as traumatic as it might have been had I been a teenager or younger.
We continued to talk for a couple of more hours, and since no one could leave, and it was getting really, really late, most everyone decided to camp out on the floor, or one of the pieces of furnature in our house. We kids, if you could call us that, picked spots on the rugs, while the grownups chose the couches and even my two grown sister’s beds, which we still had for when they or their kids occasionally stayed over.
If you’re wondering? Yes, it was a little difficult for me to fall asleep; I kept thinking about what my uncle had revealed. A few weeks later, he even showed me a photo from a newspaper that pictured my grandmother and him, when he was a little kid, going into Sing, Sing Prison to visit my grandfather before his execution.
Did I ever tell my grandmother I knew? Nope! I let her go to her grave thinking I never found out. I feel it probably saved her a lot of anxiety that way.

<h2 style="color:brown; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">The Victim</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
The front door of the Commodore Hotel opened as Mark stepped out onto the sidewalk. He stopped and looked around as if to regain his bearings. It was a little past 2:00 AM and 7th street was nearly deserted. Los Angeles, though never sleeping, redistributes its nerve centers on a time-basis and this part of the city is not considered the safest after dark. Two blocks off Wilshire, and parallel, Seventh Street is noted for its bars, hotels and that certain element of transients who frequent them. Mark normally worked the day shift and getting off this late at night felt more than a little strange to him. He felt uneasy being there, especially at that time of night, but his apartment was only a short walk, so he told himself that it was safe, and anyway he had no choice but to slough off his apprehensions and get home as quickly as possible. He squinted as he fought to see into the dense blackness across the street; the intended path to his apartment three blocks away.

Mark was a waiter who had been trained to work hotels. He liked his job well enough, which also paid very handsomely. Mark turned left, walked to the corner and stopped to wait for the light to change. Across the street, on the corner and down one flight was The Lamp Post, with its flickering neon sign which read "Bar." Exiting through the open door was a steady flow of smoke, along with an occasional drunk who attempted to negotiate the climb to street level, occasionally succeeding. When his workday was over, Mark had been known to stop by for a quick drink just to soothe his jangled nerves… but that was in the clear light of day… not tonight. He wasn’t truly afraid of the dark, as such, but this was still Los Angeles… and at this time of night… and in this neighborhood… There was an option of carrying a gun, just for protection in situations like this, but so far he hadn’t acted on it.

When the light finally blinked "Walk,” Mark stepped off the curb directly into the path of an on-coming Volkswagen. By the time the car screeched to a stand-still, he had already jumped back onto the curb vacating its path.

"What the hell are you trying to do, Lady? You want to try that again?" he shouted.

Mark walked around to the driver's side, ready for a full-blown confrontation. The car had stalled and the very attractive woman inside was slumped over the steering wheel mumbling obscenities. Mark opened the car door and was struck with the overwhelming stench of alcohol. He turned off the ignition, threw the keys in the back seat, walked to the front of the car, opened the hood, and disappeared across the street and into the darkness.

He looked down the half-block to the corner ahead and felt the hair stiffen on the back of his neck. A shrill siren sounded in the distance. As it grew louder, desperately trying to reach Central Receiving in time, the harsh wail changed to a frantic warble, warning everyone in its path of the crisis within.

Central Receiving was three blocks away. Anyone living in the neighborhood for more than a week was completely oblivious to these sounds, as well as others the city echoed after dark. Neighborhood tenants tended to retreat into their apartments at night, blocking out the trouble and violence of the streets; and there was always plenty of that. After living in this area for awhile, a growing, pervasive fear seemed to materialize and was one of the many reasons people kept to themselves. It was simply part of the overall tension one must endure to live in such a city, plus, it was just safer that way. Mark had counted the sirens once for almost an hour and finally stopped at twelve. One of the things that he’d noticed after first coming here was that people really didn't get involved in other people's lives... or problems. He had lived in the same apartment building for almost a year and knew one person there, the landlady.

The shadows of the dirty apartment buildings on either side of the street created a surreal atmosphere. The sky was just barely visible through the maze of buildings, slightly and eerily illuminated by a half moon and the smog leftover from today’s activities. There were no visible stars. There never are in this over illuminated city. Home was not far away, so he quickened his steps and even completed walking down the center of the street to avoid the dark alleyways and blind corners. Tiredness engulfed him but he still felt the ever-present, uneasy defensiveness which accompanied him on this walk home when he had to do it at night. He searched the apartment buildings on either side of Bixby Street for some signs of life. Just ahead, a garbage can clanked and rolled a few feet before stopping at a fire hydrant. Mark’s adrenalin spiked as he visually scanned the alley’s entrance to his right, but saw no movement. He stepped around the spillage and quickened his pace, moving more toward the center of the street for imagined safety. Squinting, he again searched the blackness leading into the concrete alley. A muffled groan was barely audible, then, what sounded like shoes scuffling on a sandy surface.

"Wait," someone said.

It sounded like a woman. There was anguish in her voice… desperation. More scuffling, then a dull thud; the sound a body makes when being hit by something heavy. Mark slowed his progress, straining his eyes and ears for some clue to the drama unfolding in the darkness. He looked up and down the street, searching for some sort of security… or help, or just to assure himself that he was not alone. No one was there. On the third floor of the apartment building at the end of the alley, two windows lit up, briefly illuminating patches of the alleyway. The dim light exposed two people lying on the asphalt, struggling. Once again he looked up and down the street for some sign of aid. Finding none, he slowly and cautiously entered the corridor, all the while hoping the struggling he was witnessing wasn’t serious. But, if there was a woman in trouble, he was obligated to at least try to help.

Mark spoke with as much authority as he could muster, but it was false. "Hey, what's going on there?"
The alley grew quiet. Taking this as a good sign, he slowly walked toward the two shadows. Another light flashed in one of the apartments above. Someone yelled an obscenity out his window, then, slammed down the sash. He could see one of the figures on the ground. It was a woman.

Certain that he had seen two people, he quickly searched for the other one. The woman was lying on her side, her blouse torn in several places exposing her bleeding breasts. She groaned and tried to lift her head. Mark turned and looked behind him, toward the street, desperately searching for someone... anyone… for help. He bent down and gently touched the woman on the shoulder as if to test the life remaining in a wounded animal. He heard himself ask, "Are you alright?"

Falling garbage cans sounded behind him, and as he turned toward the noise, something hit him hard in the side. Mark fell to his knees holding his pain as he watched the attacker turn and repeatedly pound the front of the woman in a stabbing motion.

The garbage can on which Mark was leaning, gave way. He was surprised at how fast he hit the ground. The windows in several apartments on the ground floors lit up as Mark called out.
"Help... Please, help! Somebody call the police! Call the police!"

Two of the windows went dark. The attacker, hearing Mark's plea, was standing over him, breathing heavy and twisting a knife in his hand. The man fell on Mark’s chest with both knees, knocking the breath out of him. Then, he covered Mark’s open mouth with his bloody, foul smelling hand and simultaneously slipped the knife blade deep between two of Mark's ribs. The attacker looked directly into his eyes, shushing him softly in short bursts, telling him quietly not to cry out; that it was no use. The attacker slipped the knife in and out of Mark’s tense stomach several times very slowly, very deliberately, as a killer would do who enjoyed total control over his victim and wanted to prolong the act. With each stab, more and more energy and life left Mark’s punctured body. The attacker waited for Mark’s eyes to soften in submission… for his body to relax, then, spoke in an almost inaudible whisper, “It’s alright… it’s alright, sh-h-h-h-h…” Mark feebly grabbed at the man as he casually walked to the street and disappeared around the corner.

Warm sticky blood filled Mark's hands and mouth… his blood. There was no terror in him now, only acceptance of the facts. He'd been stabbed several places in his stomach and kidneys. The woman lay beside him, very still. Now, they both needed help, desperately. Someone had to hear them. He knew he was badly hurt, but didn't know about the woman. She looked dead, but maybe not. Mark cupped his hands, trying to catch the precious contents of his abdomen which was spilling onto the asphalt. He felt the knife still sticking in him. His first instinct was to pull it out, but decided against the uncertain action, lest he bleed even more. Anger filled his thoughts as he quickly evaluated his situation. As an angry reflex, he grabbed the knife and in one movement, pulled it from his body, flinging it across the alley. He thought he heard a siren but wasn't sure because his ears were ringing so loudly. He turned his attention toward the woman. Sweat saturated his face, settling in his eyes. His mind was spinning in a strange and overwhelming delirium.

As he crawled to the woman, he realized she had been badly beaten, her near-naked body bruised and bleeding. He pulled himself up against the base of the apartment building and tried to think. The crawling made him bleed even worse and now he could see the stretched, open gashes in his abdomen through what was left of his shirt. Why hadn't someone come, he thought? Surely someone had heard the commotion and called the police. He listened, hoping for the wail of an ambulance rushing to save their lives; lives that were on a very short fuse. But all he heard was his own breathing and the buzzing of flies as they discovered his wounds.

What had taken place in two minutes, seemed like hours. Where were the police? He looked up at three lighted windows on the first and second floors across the alley. Occasionally a shadow stopped, looked out, then, shortly afterwards the light went out.

He looked at the woman again and saw something in her hand. He leaned over and pulled it from her frozen grasp. It was a man's wallet. It didn’t seem expensive and held few contents: a driver's license, a pawn ticket, and a few dollars. Mark coughed and tasted blood in his mouth. He took out his pen and wrote "KILLER" on the front of the wallet. He tried to read the name of the man who had killed him. The man at least owed him that, but with the sweat in his eyes, he couldn’t focus.

Mark heard someone walking up the alley and tried to call out, but all he could do was emit animal sounds that were unfamiliar to him. The shadow came closer and hesitated, straining to see more of the unnatural sight, then turned and ran back to the safety of the street. Mark coughed again. The pain was terrible. The irony of his thirst struck him with full force. He had seen abdominal wounds before, in Vietnam. He knew it was bad. He knew he couldn't have water even if some were available.

The wound was throbbing in unison with his heartbeats. Weakness engulfed him, making it almost impossible to move. Even his slightest effort multiplied the pain almost to the point of unconsciousness. It wouldn't have been so bad, he thought, if he had only done some good. But she was dead and he couldn't even help himself. What a really dumb thing to do. Barge into a situation like that, unarmed.

He heard someone coming up the alley. The figure turned the corner and walked quickly toward the woman. The man looked all around her body, felt in her hands, then rolled her over with his foot. His attention turned to Mark, as he saw the wallet in Mark’s hand. He grabbed it, kicked Mark hard in the face, then shuffled back to the street. Mark was barely conscious as he fought for breath. He heard a siren in the distance and prayed for it to be calling to him, telling him to just hang on a little while longer.

A spark of consciousness stirred as his eyelids parted halfway. He was numb over most of his body, except for where the pain had doubled… tripled. His breath came in short gasps as his mouth had long since dried up except for the new supply of blood that drooled onto the torn shards of his shirt.

All the windows were dark now as he thought he saw the sky lighten just slightly with the dawn of a new day. He couldn't be sure, sitting against the building, his eyes half open, starring at the alley entrance. No sound came from his mouth, no rhythmic rising and falling of his mutilated abdomen… nothing.


At 9:14 AM, a car stopped at the mouth of the alley. An aggressive police Lieutenant stepped out. "What happened?" he asked a uniformed policeman who was standing near-by. "Well,” the officer began, "It looks like rape and mutual homicide. The guy's fingerprints are all over the knife. Apparently, he raped her, then, beat her to death. But before he could get away, she sticks him full of holes."
"Who were they?" asked the Lieutenant.
"We're still running them down, but as far as we can determine, he was a waiter in a hotel near here; a loner, and she was a hooker who worked this area."
"Any witnesses, the Lieutenant inquired?"
"None we can locate," said the officer. "Nobody saw a thing."
"Yeah," whispered the Lieutenant, “They never do."

The End

<h2 style="color:orange; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Car Crash Horror</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
When I was thirteen years old, my baby sitter would drive to our house and pick me and my brother up and take us to her house. This was in 1988 and is a true story. My brother suffered retardation and I was considered to be ill myself, but not retardation. Our parents had a nice luxury car and house and let my baby sitter use the car. She dressed very nice when picking us up, after all, she was paid a lot. One stormy weekend, she picked us up and she drove us to her house in our parents car. She was dressed formal, wearing a black business suit with a matching skirt, tan nylons, black leather gloves and high heel pumps. My brother forgot to take his medicine. We all got in the car but she couldn't figure out how to move the driver's seat forward, so she drove the car barely reaching the pedals.

On the drive to her house, my brother kept staring at her legs while she was driving and he even touched her right leg. It startled her and she told him to not do that. When we got to her house, nobody was there for the weekend, it was just us three. She was very attractive with a very nice figure. At her house, she took off her heels and complained that her ankle hurt. My brother kept looking at her feet and legs. When it was time for bed, she showed us our bedrooms. She took my brother to his bedroom after she took me to mine. When she took him to his room, I heard a scuffle. I was scared, after all, my brother is very large and strong, i was scared of him. I sneaked down the hallway and peaked at the doorway. I saw my brother trying to hit her. She screamed, but I didn't do anything, I was scared of him. He managed to grab her and beat her up really good. She fell on the bed. I saw her pantyhosed legs and feet spread on the bed. I saw him then feel her legs and feet. Then she tried to get up and he punched her again, knocking her out. He felt up between her legs, but she still had nylons on. She managed to get up and walk down the hallway, looking for me. She found me and told me to get in the car, she was gonna take us both back to our house. She was able to convince my brother to get into the car so she could take us back home. We were not able to get him to sit in the back seat though, he sat in the front. So she started to drive. I was in the middle, to protect her from him while she drove. I was staring at her legs too while she was driving, she was very attractive. My brother remained still until a few miles out. I had no shoes on and he started to try to feel her legs while she was driving. I was in the middle and while trying to push him away, i accidentally pushed her foot into the gas pedal. She moaned in pain because I twisted it. Her left foot was in pain from earlier and she had a difficult time working the pedals. While I was fighting him, my foot got near her's and I prevented her from taking her foot off the gas pedal. She lost control, I was right beside her and we crashed.

<h2 style="color:magenta; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Nigerian Scam </h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
We’ve all had the phone calls and emails from someone in Nigeria who wanted help getting money out of the country. The scam sounded like easy money, which I knew never happened. But Jim Upright was desperate for money, especially easy money, in 1995 when the scam first appeared. A Florida good old boy in his fifties, fast-talking, smiling, successful, he also had the gift of being a serial liar. I don’t think he knew the difference between lies and truth. Like many con men, he just said whatever advanced his cause at the time. While the names have been changed to protect the innocent and guilty, this is Jim’s true story.

Jim, a boat builder in Port Canaveral, walked from his office to the front desk and asked his secretary, Mary, “Have you heard anything about Nigerian money before?”
“No. Should I?”
“I received a most interesting fax from a man in Nigeria. Look at this.” He handed Mary a single page of fax paper.
“PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Dr. Idris Musa
No. 16 Kingsway Road
Ikoyi, Lagos
Nigeria.
Tel/Fax: 234-1-7747907
30th March, 1995.
First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria. To commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us RECEIVE the said trapped funds ABROAD.

"Boss, this looks like a scam to me," Mary said.
“Keep reading.”

The source of this fund is as follows: During the regime of our late head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a Contract Review Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N).
However, due to our position as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I have, therefore been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the panel to look for an Overseas partner INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty-one Million United States Dollars) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. Hence we are writing you this letter. We have agreed to share the money thus:
70% for us (the officials)
20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you)
10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.
It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business.

Mary rolled her eyes.

Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope THAT THE FUNDS CAN ARRIVE YOUR ACCOUNT in latest ten (10) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information by TEL/FAX: 234-1-7747907: A SUITABLE NAME AND BANK ACCOUNT INTO WHICH THE FUNDS CAN BE PAID. PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO RESPOND BY TELEPHONE OR FAX.
Please acknowledge receipt of this letter using the above Tel/Fax number. I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending project when I have heard from you.
Yours Faithfully,
DR. IDRIS MUSA

“What do you think of that?” Jim asked.
“Are you serious?”
“Why not? Look at that. $31,000,000 at 20% is uh.”
“$6,200,000,” Mary said.
“Right. Just think. If this pans out, I can get out of my jam with refinancing these buildings. I think the bank is going to call the loan.”
"Yes, that would help your bank problems. Do you think its for real?”
“Maybe. Find out how to fax back to Nigeria.”

Jim faxed Dr. Musa indicating a willingness to assist with his problem. The next day another fax came in. Dr. Musa was pleased to hear from Jim and asked for a show of his sincerity. Would he be so kind as to send five pairs of Nike tennis shoes?
Jim went straight to Walmart and bought Nikes. Mary mailed them to Africa, shaking her head. Jim waited anxiously two weeks before Dr. Musa faxed another letter thanking him for the gift. Preparations for the deal were proceeding but moving the money was dangerous. Would Jim be so kind as to send another gift to prove his willingness to help move this large transaction? Maybe a Rolex watch? No problem for Jim. He had a friend at the Port who sold him a knock off for $50. Off to Africa went the watch.
Jim became antsy waiting for the deal. Mary saw the desperation grow on his face every day. A week later another fax arrived. Final preparations for the transaction were almost complete, but Dr. Musa was still nervous about trusting a stranger. Please send one more item. A large screen TV. Hmmm. Okay. Back down to Walmart to buy a TV and then to the Port to make arrangements with a shipping company to send hopefully the last item to Dr. Musa, along with a bank account number in the Cayman Islands.
Mary watched in awe of Jim’s greed. No way this could be real.

After another week of anticipation, Jim received the next fax. Dr. Musa appreciated the account information, but there was an unexpected delay in Nigeria. Unfortunately, it seemed that new government regulations made it impossible for Nigerians to export large sums of funds to overseas accounts. However, legitimate foreign businessmen, in this case Jim as a partner, could make such transactions if he presented appropriate credentials in person to the Central Bank of Nigeria in the capital of Abuja. Therefore, the obvious solution would be for Jim to fly to Abuja and join Dr. Musa at the bank to close the transaction and exchange of bank account information for the fund transfer. He could taste the money like honey. This deal was almost over.

“Mary, I need a round plane ticket to Abuja, Nigeria. Sometime this week. Get busy.”
“Are you sure you want to go to Nigeria?”
“This deal is almost done. I can taste it.”
“Okay boss.”
Four days later and after several phone calls to Dr. Musa, Jim began a brutal 22-hour flight from Orlando to Dulles to Istanbul, Turkey to Abuja. He was too nervous to sleep. $31,000,000; he'd never had that much money in his account. He wondered how long he could keep it before transferring 80% to his partner’s account. How much interest could he make each day on $31,000,000? How would he get $6,200,000 back into the States without paying income taxes? He couldn’t make numerous flights back and forth to Grand Cayman taking $9000 at a time. But he did frequently ship boats to the Caribbean. Jim would take one of his fishing boats to Grand Cayman, hide the money in a secret compartment, and motor back. Maybe five days for the whole trip. Then he would pay off the bank loan on his building and be in hog heaven.

Conditions in Istanbul’s airport were difficult. He walked at least a mile for plane transfers. He didn’t even know what he ate in the restaurants and it was old and hard. He anticipated conditions were worse in Nigeria, but he would put up with anything for $31,000,000.
Finally, the plane landed in Abuja and pulled up to the terminal. When the door opened, two policemen entered the plane and checked the passenger's passports. Sweat rolled off Jim’s face. His heart pounded. He hoped Dr. Musa had made arrangements to clear him through customs. However, when they looked at Jim’s passport, they frowned and told him, in Nigerian, to stay seated. Though he didn’t understand their language, he understood their rifles and gestures. Stay seated. When the rest of the passengers and crew deboarded, the police left and closed the airplane door.
The electricity and air conditioning shut down, which became a problem. Extreme African heat outside the plane created oven-like temperatures inside the plane. Panic crept up on Jim. What would they do to him? Visions of a vile third-world prison crept into his head. When would they let him off the plane? Would Dr. Musa come to his rescue? Surely this was a misunderstanding that would be cleared up. He paced up and down the aisle, picking through the galley for warm water and unknown snacks. Six hours later, he realized that the deal had gone south. He would not see Dr. Musa, much less any easy money. The temperature rose inside the plane, creating a horrible stench from the unventilated restrooms. Sweat poured off his body. Jim’s adrenaline level receded, and exhaustion set in. On a chair, he drifted in and out of consciousness, too worried for real sleep. What would they do to him? Who could he call for help? Would they let him call the American Embassy? He only had a few hundred dollars, not enough for a decent bribe. Waiting for the unknown was tortuous. Would they let him return home? More pacing. Jim’s misery level grew. Eighteen hours after landing, workers refueled the plane and made flight preparations on the ground. Good. He wanted to leave this God-forsaken place.

After twenty-two hours the electricity came on and the doors opened. The two policemen returned and leered at him while they stood by the door to make sure he stayed aboard. Passengers filed aboard and stewardesses made flight preparations. With all the travelers seated, the police left and closed the door. When the wheels left the ground, Jim’s exuberation to be returning home outweighed the loss of money. But his tribulations were not over. Rearranging his flights in Istanbul without speaking the language proved most difficult and expensive. Thank goodness for credit cards. Two days later, he landed in Orlando, frumpled, exhausted, and heartbroken. He wasn’t used to being on the receiving end of a scam. He was usually the coner, not the conee. Hopefully he could find a better deal next time.
