<h2 style="color:green; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">TThe Cemetery</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
When you are a journalist, you have to get used to a routine, get up, have breakfast, take a shower, check your mail and then look at your cell phone to check the time and scream.

"I'm late again!"

Run as fast as you can and find a taxi, ask it to fly through the air and pray that traffic does not catch up with you, arrive five minutes early, straighten your hair and sit as if nothing had happened, at least that's how I had used to me.

Ten minutes after I sit down, Melissa comes over to my table, holds a photo in her hand and hands it to me.
- And that?
- It's for your work today, create an article with that, the painting is called The Merry Cemetery, Amrita Sher-Gil painted it, write something about it, whatever, no more than 400 words, it's for the corner of the eleven, have it ready by 10:30
- OK perfect.

Melissa leaves and I keep the photo in my hand, thinking, then I open Word and start with a blank page, I start writing.

"The Merry Cemetery (Image above) is a work of modern art painted by Amrita Sher-Gil in 1939, it represents a cemetery in low tones and ocher colors, if you ask me the image is quite beautiful ..."

It can't be, could it be that I got writer's block ?, I shake my head and start to write again, I erase again and think again, suddenly, an idea occurs to me, maybe Melissa doesn't like it , but I'm going to try.

I search on Google until I find what I find, it's perfect, I start writing again

“The Merry Cemetery (Image above) is a modern work of art-painted by Amrita Sher-Gil in 1939, it represents a cemetery in low tones and ocher colors, but today we are not talking about that, we are going to read a story based in this painting, dating back to 1957, the author's name was Agata Montoya Gil "

"The cemetery still at night vibrated with its ocher colors, a beautiful sight if you ask me, the silence was so deep that you could hear the breaths of the dead, buried in their graves, dead in body, but alive in soul Looking at us from the sky, thinking about it gave me a chill, but I keep going, the history of this cemetery is precious and I am not going to let the fact that the dead live elsewhere haunt me.

Around 1889, when Tom Sawyer was beginning to grow up, the mother of a very happy young man died, her death left him very tormented, but when he saw that his mother was going to be buried in the ground with a gray slab on top, it seemed to him terrible, his mother had been a woman full of life and color, so he decided to change the rules of burials and began to sculpt a cross in clay, when it dried, he began to paint it with colors, red, orange, yellow, gray , It was not very colorful, but it gave a twist to things, that's how it started, currently the cemetery through which I walk is the same as that young man began to build a different cemetery, that's why I walk here, because I want to fill myself with that energy and The enthusiasm that made the young man build this cemetery, the air that is breathed here is pure, full of life despite being in a place where death is king."

<h2 style="color:purple; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">The Cry In The Night</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">	
It was too late at night and i was going home from office then i saw a little on my way.But when i stopped my car and saw no one there.I was about to leave Then i heard someone is crying. When i listened carefully The sound was coming behind a tree I slowly went near that tree and saw that a little girl was crying there. But when i called her she suddenly stopped crying and smile in a creepy way. I was very scared and ran towards my car.Then i started going towards my home from there. i thought while going that Am i doing it all right leaving a little girl there.Then i went back to that place again. I went near the tree where that little girl was crying but strangely no one there, But when i went to my car that girl were standing there.
Then i asks her home address but she didn't say anything then she went and sat inside my car.
I gave her a chocolate bar to eat but she didn't eat and was sitting quietly inside the car.
After sometime she pointed towards a lane with ger finger.
I thought maybe her house would be inside that lane so i stopped my car and let her go.
She was going towards that lane and that lane was quite dark.
I thought maybe she would be scared so i went with her.
Walking a short distance she stopped in front of a house then i thought maybe it's her house.
I was gonna ask her this but she disappeared from there.
I realized that she must have gone home that's why i also came to my home.
The next day when i woke up and saw the same girl on the news and the news was that 2 days ago three man brutally raped inside a car and throw her to die.
Then i found a note inside my car

<h2 style="color:pink; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">THERE'S SOMEONE UNDER THE BED</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
He did not like the gift. He never asked for it. He hated it. He never knew when it was going to come again. He hoped it would not. Not ever. It had been over a year. Maybe it was gone. Maybe he lost the gift. His head started to hurt. He wanted to cry. It was the gift.

The man was unloading some bags from the trunk of his car. The Motel door was just a yard or so from the front of his car. He licked his lips. He knew it was going to be a wonderful night. Not for her…but for him. He never even saw the slender troubled looking man until he was right next to him. It shook him for a second. But only a second. He was smooth. He had lied to lie detectors, to lawyers, to psychiatrists, to the Police. They all believed him. He was good. Not good as in a “good man”…just good at fooling other people. He would talk his way out of this…he always did.

The slender man simply asked him one question:

“What’s her name?”

“Who?”

It was only then, when he turned to look at the slender troubled man that he noticed his eyes. For the first, and last time. A moment later a combination of fear, guilt, shame, and…revenge surged through the man outside the motel. He felt his body start to heat up. Like his skin was on fire. It was. He looked back up as the fat under his skin started to bubble out. He could smell charred meat. He wanted to scream. His vocal chords were already burned away. One of the bags he was holding burst into flames. The other just fell to the asphalt.

Then there was just a pile of ash. A brief puff of wind made a dust devil out of what was once a human being. Well, maybe not Human…or at least not fully.

The slender troubled man rubbed his temples. He picked up the key to the motel from the left over dust. He opened the door. The girl on the bed was wide eyed. Ankles, wrist, and mouth taped. The slender troubled looking man smiled gently. He took the tape off of the girls ankles, then her wrists, rubbing them to help the blood circulate. Then he took the tape off of her mouth. She couldn’t cry out, her mouth was dry, her lips swollen and bleeding.

The slender man got some water and made her take small sips. He held her when the shock wore off. He had her call her Mother. She asked him how he knew where she was. He smiled a sad smile.

“It’s a gift.”

<h2 style="color:brown; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Bad Nickle</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
It seemed as if the nickel sat on that windowsill for weeks. Every time I passed by, I’d look down, and there it would be sitting on that three-inch shelf along with a couple of salt and pepper packets from McDonald’s. Why the packets? Who knows? But why no one took the nickel seemed even more of a mystery to me. So why didn’t I take it if I was so aware of it? I’m not completely sure, but the idea of taking that nickel seemed—I don’t know—kind of like stealing?
Yeah, I know that doesn’t make sense, but that’s what I kept thinking. I mean, whom would I be stealing from? It wasn’t as if the nickel had anyone’s name engraved on it. It was just a plain, old, everyday nickel with a slight nick on one of its edges. And yet, there it lay tempting me each time I passed.
Like I said, this seemed to go on for weeks, but then one day when I passed by the windowsill on the way to the stall, I found the nickel gone! For some reason, I felt more sad than surprised. Seeing the nickel there every day felt as if I was participating in some kind of game. But now the game was over, so I continued into the stall to do my thing.
Yes, I’m talking about a bathroom stall, but it wasn’t just any bathroom. It was the bathroom that many of the employees as well as a number of the managers used at the auto dealership where I worked. So now that it was gone, my one thought was, I wonder who finally took it? Unless I ask, I’ll probably never know. So shrugging off all thoughts of the coin, I continued with my business, until the following day when I saw the nickel had returned!
What the hell?
I wondered why you’re back, I thought to myself? Of course, I had no idea. Maybe someone had decided it was bad luck to have taken it in the first place. That was a stupid idea I told myself, until I saw one of the lot boys walking around with a cast on his arm. That started me thinking.
“What did you do?” I asked him, as we passed each other.
He turned and replied, “I tripped going up a flight of stairs and fell on my arm.”
Cringing, I thought, Ouch!
I also thought to myself, I wonder was that before or after you took the nickel? I had no proof it was him, of course, but that’s what I thought, and then I laughed at myself. That was silly. But it didn’t seem so silly when, after the next time the nickel disappeared, one of the sales people showed up wearing one of those medical boots.
“What did you do, fall?” I asked, thinking I was being clever.
But he replied, “Yeah, how did you know?”
“Just a guess,” I said, as I felt myself begin to blush.
“Actually, I tripped over my wife’s cat and hurt my ankle.”
That’s why you shouldn’t have taken the nickel, I thought again.
At this point, I couldn’t help but think that this whole thing with the nickel was getting a little freaky! Not only because it actually seemed possible that the nickel was somehow cursed, but how in the hell did it always manage to find its way back to the windowsill? Did it just magically appear there by itself? I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.
Then it disappeared for a couple of days and that’s when the dealership almost burnt down. It took the fire department nearly twenty minutes to put out the fire, which destroyed a couple of our most expensive vehicles, and seared the face of one wall. I couldn’t stop wondering who had taken the coin this time? Had it been someone at the top—maybe the owner himself? If it was him, I bet that stung something fierce. I know it would have me.
Now, when I passed by the window, I made sure to give the nickel (which had returned once again) a wide berth. But then one day, I decided to take a chance and try something. No, I didn’t take the nickel for myself. I merely nudged it with my index finger until it fell on the floor, at which point, I kicked it under a planter someone from the office thought would help brighten up the bathroom.
Nothing major happened to me, but I did get a nasty paper cut on the same finger I used to push the nickel off the windowsill. So just to play it safe, that night before going home, I retrieved the nickel from under the planter and put it back on the windowsill. And then I waited. Sure enough, one of the valets showed up with his hand heavily bandaged. They said he got a couple of his fingers caught in a car door. Once again, I had to think, Ouch!
This whole thing with the nickel was starting to creep me out. That’s why I began to seriously think about maybe changing jobs, but then they transferred me to a different part of our dealership, which meant I didn’t have to see or think about the nickel anymore; until, that is, it showed up one day in the bathroom next to my new office. Talk about nearly having a heart attack! Was that damned thing following me? Was I somehow the reason it even started showing up in the first place?
The next week, our General Manger ended up getting himself run over by a car on our lot, even though no one had been driving it. By then, an acquaintance of mine had offered me a more lucrative position at another dealership, which I gladly took.
Everything was going along great until one day, I spotted a couple of people with band aids stuck to various parts of their bodies. I wondered, could this have anything to do with the shiny new penny I noticed on the counter in one of the main bathrooms? God, I hope not!

<h2 style="color:orange; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Our Daughter</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
She woke up to her daughter screaming out loud,

"Mummmmmmmy!"

Quickly, she sprinted towards her daughter's room. The little girl was lying at the corner of the room, panting, and holding her hands over her head, covering the face, as if she was trying to hide from somebody.

She hugged her and yelled,

"Sweety! Sweety! It's me! Mom has come! Don't worry! Calm down! Calm down! Relax! What happened?"

The little girl cried out loud, "Mummy! Mummy! There's someone roaming around in our house!"

Placing her over the chest and brushing her hands into the little girl's hair, she replied,

"No Sweety, there is no one! You just had a bad dream! Calm down! Stop crying! I'm there!"

Pointing towards the door, the little girl screamed, "Mom! There it is! See! Mummmmmmmy! There!"

She turned back to see a silhouette, holding a knife in hand. Her eyes went wide. She hugged her daughter all over and tried to scream out for help, but no words came out of her mouth.

It moved close to them, and looking into her eyes, it said,

"Sometimes, you have to listen to little kids! They speak truth!" And, stabbed her right into her heart with the knife.

She squealed, "Aaaaaaaahhhh!"

Her husband woke up and shouted,

"Hey! Hey! Relax! Calm down! May be you had a bad dream! Relax! Relax! Cool!"

She looked around, up and down, hugged her husband, and mumbled,

"Oh! That's a very bad dream!"

She got down the bed and moved towards her daughter's room. The little girl was still sleeping. She smiled, kissed her daughter on the forehead and returned to her bed.

Her husband asked, "Where did you go?"

She smilingly replied, "I just went to have a glance of our daughter, Sweety!"

He whispered, "Have you gone nuts? We don't have a daughter!"

<h2 style="color:magenta; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Magical Doll </h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
Once upon a time, there was an old man who was sick most of the time. He had a grandson and a granddaughter named Tom and Julia. They both loved their grandpa very much. One day there was rain pouring outside and weather went bad. Grandpa felt ill and his body temperature becomes warm. Julia told Tom to buy medicines since they didn’t have any more left. He said that weather outside so bad and gloomy and also because of fog he may get lost while going. She told him to go as soon as possible because grandpa was feeling very sick. After a short time, tom went to buy medicines. A light drizzle has started by the time he left. Fresh ocean breeze keeps the climate pleasant but it was this sudden change of grandpa’s sickness. Julia was waiting desperately for Tom as grandpa’s illness casted a cloud over her happiness. As tom reached, he found the shop to be closed. He was angry because he missed the boat due to weather. Tired and annoyed tom was unhappy and gradually worrying about grandpa’s situation. While he was returning, he saw the sky cleared up after heavy rain. As he began to move towards home, he saw a fetching doll with tape covering its lips. He looked at her and thought to give it to Julia as she will be upset with him. Tom continued his walk towards home with doll on his hand. There was a little noise that he noticed and found out that it was coming from the doll. He eventually took the tape from her lips and was surprised to see that the doll was speaking to him. He didn’t believe what just happened. He was scared and was speechless. Doll said to tom that she knew about his problem and if he follows as she says he will be returning home satisfied. Tom was willing to do anything at the drop of a hat. She told about a remedy that will help grandpa in any disease for very long time. Doll told him about a plant which was in a cave. She said if his grandpa drinks its juice he will be all well in no time. There was an issue that doll mentions that the cave is in underground water. All people of that town know about that underwater cave but no one ever went there before. She told him everything and now he has to decide whether he will do or not the ball is in his court. Tom was not very good at swimming but he decided to go and
search for that plant. Doll instructed him all the way as he finally got inside and saw the plant. As soon as he was cutting it off a large nasty crocodile was coming to strike. Doll made all efforts to buy him time to take away that plant. He finally took away and was out of breath when he got out of that dangerous cave. He saw that the doll was not with him, he tried to look for the doll but the doll was nowhere to be found. He soon realized that grandpa would be waiting for medicine so he decided to go home as soon as possible. Julia was with grandpa and was worried for Tom. She heard a knock-on door afterwards and speaks of the devil, here he comes. Julia started asking so many questions but tom told her to zip her lips and was making plant juice for grandpa in a hurry. He fed him
eventually and a miracle happened, grandpa started feeling better than ever before, as right as rain. Julia was shocked to see what just happened but Tom stays still in silence and was completely lost.
