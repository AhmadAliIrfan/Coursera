<h2 style="color:green; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">The Virus Will Win </h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
The Virus Will Win

It is clear to me that we are unable to stop the roaring Covid. This is not an AIDS where we can make choices to control viral exposures. It is far more contagious. Our feeble attempts to flatten the curve failed despite shutting down the US economy. Under that plan with no vaccine, all people who were going to catch Covid would catch it over a long slow period that would not overload the hospitals. That did not work. People became bored and complacent. They refused to wear those god awful masks and heaven forbid stay six feet away from each other. How is that too much to ask?

Now vulnerable older people such as my wife and I, who would have caught Covid slowly, or maybe lasted until a vaccine came out, will catch it incredibly fast and overwhelm the medical system. Will this save the economy? No one knows. The same number of deaths may occur, just all at once like occurred in New York City.

My only hope is to be a safe hermit until a vaccine comes out in a year or two for everybody. I certainly won’t qualify for an early shot. Those who don’t care about being sick will catch Covid and mostly live while spreading it to those of us who are weak. We are seeing Darwinism at its best. Or worst, as Mother Nature carries on with her periodic population control..

<h2 style="color:purple; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">My Diary of Depression</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">	
My Diary Of Depression

(3-14-19)
Mom chose to have four kids. When she can’t take care of us emotionally or physically, we are the ones who suffer for her decision of having all of us. She should’ve just not had me. I’d be better off dead. Better off in heaven, where there is no sin or pain. Why can’t I just be dead? Everything would be better. For everyone. I could actually get love and attention, and I wouldn’t just be another person. Nobody cares. Except Claire. She cares. I matter to her. Claire, Lauren, Taylor, Tye, Grammy and Papaw, Jeannie, Corey, Jack, Zane, Haiden, and the Greenlaws. That’s why I live. That’s why I’m not dead yet. Because if I was, their lives would be ruined forever. I couldn’t do that to them. So I have to live. For them.
I just wish they could see. I just wish they could understand. But they don’t. No one does. Everyone thinks of me as a happy, positive little girl with the perfect life. But I don’t. I hardly get attention. I’m just there for the chores. Just there. A burden.

(3-19-19)
I feel so apart from Claire. I really feel like dying. I just don’t want to live. Why should I live? Who would miss me? Would Claire? She is frustrated me. I’m scared that she might turn out like Savannah. That I will lose her like I lost my relationship with Sav. I can’t lose her too. I just can’t. She says to trust her, but can I? I’ve trusted so many people and every single person turned around and betrayed me. Whenever things started to go bad I was left behind. I was just there. (Little Do You Know-Alex and Sierra) Who would care if I died? I don’t think anything would really change. I would be in Heaven-no sadness or pain. Everything would be perfect. In Heaven do you miss people? Would I miss Claire? Sav? Joel? I really don’t know. Would they miss me? Again, I really don’t know. I can’t bear to be broken again. Not again. I was broken last night. Cried for hours. Couldn’t stop. I don’t want my and Claire’s relationship to be at risk but how am I gonna see her today when I feel so apart from her? We were so close. But she is frustrated with me. Living Science isn’t fair to her.
She gets hardly any sleep, even when she is sick. She forgets to eat, and doesn’t sleep. That was how it all started with Sav. She promised me she would be ok. That everything would be fine. But will it? I don’t know. No one knows. Hopefully everything will turn out fine. I hope Claire is right and I can trust her.
All it takes is a smile. No one knows. I tell everyone I’m fine but deep inside I’m thinking of all the ways I’m not fine. Anxiety, depression, self-harm thoughts, death. But just one smile, and they believe you. I don’t blame them. They can’t read my mind or my emotions. No one can. But I just wish someone would see and give me a hug and tell me everything would be fine. I wish someone knew that it was a journey and not just once but always encourage and support me, always knowing something is wrong. I want everyone to stop acting like everything is fine.


Well, I just told Claire. She has supported me so far, and I knew I needed to tell someone. I just want someone to know. Someone I trust. I trust her completely. She needed to know. She is supportive and encouraging, and actually cares and loves me. She doesn’t push me and doesn’t act any differently around me. I’ve lost so many friends when things got hard it feels good to tell her and not lose our friendship for once. I just told Lauren too. She promised she wouldn’t leave me. I hope she doesn’t. She just told me she would die without me. I don’t know if that’s true but it’s encouraging either way.
I hope I didn’t make a mistake. Lauren has been asking people to pray for me, and I’m guessing Claire has too. Just told Joel. He apparently isn’t very supportive. He told me that part of life is being happy and cheerful for other people even when you’re having a bad day. I regret telling him now, because he just made things worse.

(3-21-19)
What is depression? What does it feel like? Well, I know first hand. It doesn’t just feel like sadness. It feels like I’m drowning and I have to listen to everyone else have fun while they are oblivious to me dying inside. I go everywhere and no one knows. No one cares. Because everyone is focused on their own problems. Not somebody else’s.

(3-22-19)
Laurel is everyone’s favorite child. I don’t hate her, but I am jealous of the attention she gets. I’m just in the background. Oh Laurel doesn’t want to watch that movie? We won’t watch it. Oh it might possibly maybe make Laurel a little scared or Chloe a little scared? Definitely not watching that. They don’t care if I want to watch an action movie. We never get to watch action movies. Like, ever. Savannah and Joel are too busy with work and school and Laurel only likes all the movies I don’t like. I wish I got some attention.
I wish someone in my family cared.

(3-23-19)
Why do they have to crush my dreams? They get me all excited for something, and then they just change their minds. I’m alone. My friends don’t know what it’s like, my family pretends they understand, but that just makes it worse. Because they don’t. They act like everything is fine. But it’s not. I WANT to die. How is that fine? I’m alone. My counselor thinks she cares, but she doesn’t. It’s just part of her job. My family thinks that making me hang out with people will make me better. But again, it just makes things worse. They tell me not to have an attitude, but now I can’t even be excited for anything because they always change their plans. They don’t care. I’ve been telling myself they did. But they don’t. I wish someone out there cared. I wish someone out there actually understood, and instead of telling me everything would be fine (false info) they would tell me they understood.
I walk around, do my activities and no one knows. They treat me the same way, whether it be kicking me to the curb, or destroying my self confidence.

<h2 style="color:pink; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Inhuman human(Poem)</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
All this world's engaged in a yarn
unsolved, unsettled in a constant Darn
nobody accepts nobody admits
all marching on riddles
orbiting round a Labyrinth
they talk in bedlams, hear in commotions;
Try to explain but ain't hear a notion;
Empty herds full of shrieks and Roars,
Like a rolling stone gathering no moss
He whispers, he lies,
his hands dipped in a red dye
often spelling beans and summoning committing crimes but no reckoning
because the tag of 'humans' he bears.
There's nothing he got to explain
nothing he needs to care...

<h2 style="color:brown; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Escape</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
I just spent 20 days in a nursing home; watching over my mother as she convalesced and went through rehab. I was with her when she fell, and I figured that, since I ‘broke her’…well, you know. It’s hard not to observe the comings and goings of a place like that. This story describes one of the ‘goings’ I observed. Yes, I am guilty of a little dramatic license. I thought this story might be a little amusing, but it’s actually quite heartbreaking.

He waited patiently among the crowd of people; who were loitering around the entrance. Today was the day of some kind of party, or gathering in the building; so he blended in somewhat. Was it his plan all along? Or, maybe these ‘ripe’ circumstances just demanded that he take advantage of the situation. It was the perfect storm of cover and confusion. Maybe the ‘powers that be’ felt he deserved a shot at slipping out. A shot at freedom; perhaps another opportunity to do all the things he had left undone in his otherwise full life. One moment he was blending in with the crowd; the next, he was out the door.

One could only guess what was going through his mind as he realized that he had made it through. Past the barrier that had confounded so many; his mind raced now that he had broke that, previously unbreakable, plane. But, no sooner than he tasted this first fleeting moment of freedom, he found himself in the grasp of one of his captors. “STOP!” he probably heard, as a rough-speaking, heavy-handed jailer grabbed his arm and pulled. ‘Was there no code of conduct for these ‘monsters’, who were holding him against his will’, he thought; as another guard joined the first.

All was lost. All was, indeed, lost as the ruthless animals (his eyes and mind were seeing), pulled him back into the facility. The actual attendants and voices, which were seen and heard by the lucid people witnessing the scene, were actually gentle and compassionate. “Come on honey… let’s go inside”, one said as he accompanied them back into his ‘prison’. “We’d miss you if you left us Mr. ‘Blank’," the other one added as they gently escorted him.

As the three walked down the hallway, his mind slowed again and began to collect itself. You could almost hear the whirling and clinking inside his head as he began to formulate the intricate details of the next ‘great nursing home escape’.

If you have a friend or loved one in a nursing home, VISIT THEM OFTEN!

<h2 style="color:orange; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">Realization</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
Amanda and John, a dashing couple in mid thirties did not realize when their relationship turned toxic and the day came when John had to approach the judiciary. John cannot forget how Amanda would always find him at fault and take no responsibility for her erratic behavior. One day John booked tickets for a cantata at an Opera House and decided to surprise Amanda. Amanda looked beautiful that evening. When they reached the Opera House and approached their seats, Amanda got furious at John for not booking the front row seats. She darted out of the Opera House towards the street in hysteria. John could not understand why was she so fussy about it instead of being happy for the surprise. She started shouting at him on the streets. Seemed like the anger was gestating for a long time. John tried to calm her down but she was being so impersonal that he felt emasculated. John looked totally abashed. He realized that his every effort to please Amanda was nothing but wasting time and effort securing a bauble.

<h2 style="color:magenta; font-weight: bold; font-family: courier; font-size: 30px;">The tunnel of the unloved(Poem) </h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: courier; color: black;font-weight: bold;">
Pull me inside out and expose me to the world, let them gawk and stare at my vulnerability which I can no longer be bothered to hide and let them laugh at my inner pain, I no longer care.

The tunnel of darkness has closed in on me again at one end, the flashing orange lights of warning on the barricade to tell me that mental maintenance is due and I'm to stay away for now, and the light at the other keeps moving, it keeps getting further and further away and I don't want to run after it right now, I'm too tired and I'm too heavy to move.

I'll sit here quietly in my solitude and despair, I'll comfort myself with my loneliness because at least I know it's better to be alone than inflict myself upon those who do not understand what it feels like to be pressed so heavily in sadness, in this tunnel of never ending darkness. The walls have closed around me but they are keeping me safe. They are damp and insidious but they protect me from myself and whilst I am alone, whilst there is no one to hold my hand and wait with me, I can reboot my brain, let my imagination shut down and restart again knowing that the nightmares I have been enduring will have passed and the storm clouds will clear once again.

How long for I don't know. A few days, a few weeks, if Im lucky, a month or maybe 2, it doesn't matter though, just as long as I can finally stand on my own and walk towards the light and stand outside the tunnel in the real world knowing that I survived another dark day. You can tell me to grow up, to stop complaining, that it's all in my head, that I have nothing to worry about. You can tell me I'm lucky, that I'm better off than most, that I have everything to live for and I'll tell you that I don't want to live, I want to hide and stay hidden, that I want to be forgotten and remembered for everything I didn't do.

I am loved and neglected. Stable and falling apart. Happy and desperately lost. Cold and too hot to care. I am everything and nothing. I am high and falling down. I change like the weather, I am a storm that never ends.

Some of my friends understand me, they listen to me go on and on about this and that and they never judge a word I say. Why should they? It's not their place to judge, just to be there when I need someone to hold me up when I feel like crumbling forever to the ground. Some of my friends tell me to cheer up, that life is not that bad and they berate me for giving in so easily, and I just smile and walk away, shaking my head in frustration as I wish it was as simple as that. Most people know why I suffer with crippling depression, but not all of them understand it. Some glare at me with shock and tell me to get help! They think I am mad, they wonder..."Did she actually say that or write that?" They are the ones who make me laugh, the ones I let think that I might actually be crazy. Some praise me for being as strong as I am, and some do not understand how I manage to keep going, how I haven't failed and given in to my weakness. I have done, I still do, I just don't lean on everyone as not everyone is strong enough to take it, so I hide in my tunnel of darkness, I sit quietly on my own, listening to the deafening storm inside my head and wait patiently for it to pass.

Would you know how I suffer sometimes? How anyone like me suffers? Do you know how much physical pain this depression causes and how much anger I have to suppress just so I don't flip out in public places and cause a scene an embarrass other people? I have learned to stay hidden, learned to be quiet and hide myself away. I can survive on my own now when I thought I needed someone to help me but I really don't. I am happier knowing that I can retreat to the tunnel of the unloved any time I choose and no one can ask me why or where I'm going. I can just go and sit there for a while, reboot and reinstall my life back to it's factory settings, ready to face another day or 2, or 3, ready to present myself once more as a normal, balanced, untainted human being.

This is written on a dark day. The sun is shining and I am with people I love and who love me, yet the day is as dark as though the world has come to an end. I slept for hours. I stared at the wall for ages. I forgot my name and who I was as I began to shut down. I have been in the tunnel this time for 3 days and whilst I'll be out soon, whilst the light at one end is coming closer, I'm not sure if and when I'll be ready to leave.
